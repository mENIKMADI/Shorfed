This is my first repository on GitHub
I am currently enrolled at ASU online in the full-stack web developer bachelors program
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the terminal, GitHub, and Linux are my main focuses at the moment
I am following along with TheOdinProject 
If you find this and are a noob or have any advice, feel free to message me
Stay focused friends!!
